# Automated-parking-system
**Introduction**

Our project focuses on creating an entirely automated car parking system to reduce human involvement and save time. With a growing population, we aim to minimize the time wasted on finding parking spots and reduce traffic congestion. Our innovative approach minimizes accidents and frustrations caused by traditional parking methods. We introduce a smart system where users can book parking spaces in advance, and vehicles can park automatically using sensors. Our goal is to provide a secure, efficient, and real-time automated parking experience, setting a new standard for future parking systems.
