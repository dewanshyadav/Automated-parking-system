# Automated-parking-system
**Introduction**

The main aim that we have is to create a completely automated car parking system with minimal human
interference. With the rising population in the world, time is of the essence and hence we need to
minimize the time taken by trivial activities such as finding a place to park in a busy place and avoid traffic
congestion. We have seen in existing systems sometimes accidents can occur in parking situations by cars
going at high speed or caused by frustrated drivers unable to find a parking space for a long period of
time.In our project we propose a smart and automated car parking model that will help the user in
booking their parking spaces beforehand and the vehicle will be able to park automatically once in the
parking zone .The difference between our project of automated car parking systems is we hope to
minimize human interaction as much as possible and make both the vehicle and the parking area fitted
with sensors that will help us execute a safe and efficient way of parking. Hence, we aim to provide a
completely safe and automated experience that is robust and can be implemented in real time and
hopefully be implemented as the general norm for parking systems in the future.
